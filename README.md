#####Body#####

1. A Diſcovery of the firſt Wiſdom from beneath, and the ſecond Wiſdom from above, or, The difference betwixt the two •eeds, the one after the fleſh, the other after the Spirit.

    _ I. The Wiſdom from beneath which leadeth into bondage, and the Wiſdom from above which leadeth up into perfect libertie, where there is freedom and Communion with the Father and the Son.

    _ II. All labouring and ſtriving by forms, cuſtomes, and traditions, comes ſhort of that worſhip in Spirit and in Truth. The wayes the two men walk in, viz. the Spirituall and the carnall, the difference betwixt them, and how you may know them by their fruits.

    _ III. How the ſubtiltie of the Serpent workes in the Children of diſobedience; and how he rages where he ſees the image of the Prince of Peace appear, to ſmother and ſtrangle the holy Child Jeſus.

    _ IV. A Caution to all who ſhall be found perſecutors, perſecuting the righteous, not ſuffering that Spirit to ſpeak, which boldly and impartially ſpeaks without ſlaviſhneſs, being carried up above, fears not him who can kill the Body, and can do no more, but fears God.

    _ V. A call to the world, to repentance, and the curſed condition that men lie in, profeſsing much but practiſing juſt nothing but pride, wantonneſs, covetouſneſs, and yet cover themſelves with large profeſsions, and call themſelves Saints, wo, wo to all them who profeſs the truth, and live in unrightneſs and that turne the grace of God into wantonneſs.

    _ VI. The curſed condition of conceited ones, who are wiſe in their own eyes.
